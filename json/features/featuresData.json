Although she temporarily lost her job after defending Credence from his horrible mother (which was the right thing to do), she did everything in her power to get it back. She was diligent, focussed on her goal and her perseverance eventually paid off. When she found herself back in her dream position, she fully committed to it and didn’t look back. If dedication to career is something you admire, then we think Tina would be your role model. We reckon you’re someone that has already found their passion in life and are willing to do anything it takes to work towards achieving it. Whether that’s setting up your own business, snagging that latest promotion or pay rise, studying incredibly hard, or putting in hours of practice, you have your dream job in mind, and you’ll do anything to get it."

There is nobody in the wizarding world quite like her and she couldn’t care less if she stands out from the crowd. From her Spectrespecs to her radish earrings to her belief in the weird and wonderful, she’s not someone to give into peer pressure and doesn’t get embarrassed. If you’re someone that has a strong sense of self and wouldn’t allow anyone to pressure you to change, then Luna is your role model. The two of you would appreciate each other’s individuality and would support and encourage each other to explore your likes, dislikes and what makes you distinctly you."

She also managed to do this while running her household and being a member of the Order of the Phoenix.

She threw herself into everything and was incredibly brave. If you’re the adventurous sort, not only do we think you would you admire her courage, but we think she would inspire you to push yourself out of your comfort zone and find something that truly excites you.

In fact, she was just as, if not more, talented than Harry was as a Seeker. It was only because he had the faster broom that he was able to defeat her when they met on the Quidditch pitch. As the only witch on the Ravenclaw team, she would have been a role model to all the witches in Ravenclaw (and other houses) that had ambitions of playing the famous wizarding sport too. If you’re a sporty person, who works hard to ensure you’re at the top of your game, then we think that Cho Chang would be who you looked up to.

She’s unafraid to say exactly what she thinks and is very sure in her sense of right and wrong. Who can forget the time she basically called Dolores Umbridge incompetent when she tried to suggest Harry would never be an Auror? Though many find her a little stern, there is no doubt that she commands the respect of those around her. If you’re a person that is never afraid to give their opinion and doesn’t second guess their decisions, Minerva McGonagall is the role model for you. We imagine you are straight-talking, know how to command a room and always walk with your head held high. "

But there are many more layers to this inspirational witch. One of those things happens to be her loyalty. Fleur is dedicated to those she cares about. You just have to look at the way she stuck by Bill after he was attacked by Fenrir Greyback to see that. There was also the way the way she stayed loyal to Harry – years after he rescued her sister during the second task of the Triwizard Tournament. Not only did she help in the fight against Voldemort, but she provided shelter for Harry, Ron and Hermione at her home after the events of Malfoy Manor. As someone who prides themselves on being loyal, we think you would look up to Fleur. You would admire the way she sticks by her loved ones and would try to take a leaf out of her book when it comes to your relationships."

Are you unafraid to learn from your mistakes? Then we think you would look up to Ginny Weasley. Out of all the characters in Harry Potter, Ginny was probably someone who had one of the biggest transformations. She went from being the timid child who struggled to say a word to Harry, to one of the fiercest and most resilient witches in the wizarding world. This growth is perfectly illustrated by how she managed to overcome the traumatic experience of being possessed by Tom Riddle’s diary. It would have been easy – and very understandable – if she had withdrawn into herself after that event. But she didn’t. Though the incident always remained with her, she not only managed to get on with her life but grew in confidence too. During the rest of her time at Hogwarts, her sense of humour, sporting skill, rebellious streak, Bat-Bogey Hex ability and emotional practicality flourished. She’s definitely a witch that would inspire you to keep working to become the best version of yourself. "

A blood oath currently means that Dumbledore is blocked from moving against Grindelwald himself, and it is up to his former student, Newt Scamander, to fight for what is right. But, as you have seen from our first glimpses of the new film, he certainly isn’t alone. In fact, the band of witches, wizards (and one Muggle!) is being dubbed “Dumbledore’s first army.”\n\nIt is comforting to see that Dumbledore has always had groups form around him in times of unrest: a testament to his stature as a truly great wizard. As he once said himself, in *Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire*: “We are only as strong as we are united, as weak as we are divided.”"

              "text": "## Their first meeting\nAlbus Dumbledore first met Gellert Grindelwald at a rather difficult time in his life, when he was seventeen years old. He had just finished his studies at Hogwarts, where he had excelled at everything, been Head Boy and won prize after prize – including the Barnabus Finkley Prize for Exceptional Spell-Casting. This exciting stage of his life had been set to continue, as he was supposed to go on a tour of the world with his friend Elphias Doge. However, tragedy struck on the eve of their trip. His mother, Kendra, was killed in an accident and Albus had to return to Godric’s Hollow to take care of his brother, Aberforth and sister, Ariana. This was no easy task, as after being brutally attacked by a group of Muggle boys, his sister had turned her magic inwards, was unstable, sometimes dangerous and needed constant care. \n\nIt just so happened that during that summer another wizard was preparing to spend some time in that particular village, Gellert Grindelwald. He had come to stay with his great aunt Bathilda Bagshot. Like Albus, Gellert was another gifted young wizard. However, according to Rita Skeeter (who isn’t known for being an especially reliable source), rather than channelling his abilities into winning prizes and achievements, Grindelwald had taken a different path and had been expelled from the Durmstrang Institute as a result. \n\nYet, as two highly intelligent wizards of the same age who were stuck in a small village, it is easy to understand why these two were drawn to one another. Dumbledore and Grindelwald soon struck up a friendship, bouncing ideas off one another, obsessing over the Deathly Hallows and coming up with their plan of how the wizarding world could look if Muggles were subservient to wizards. \n\nTheir conversations served as an escape for Dumbledore, who had felt trapped after the death of his mother and allowed him to imagine a future where he was free to do as he pleased. Dumbledore believed that if he and Grindelwald were successful at finding all the Hallows, not only would they become immensely powerful and the masters of death, but he could use the Resurrection Stone to bring his parents back and lift all the responsibility he had from his shoulders.\n\nYet, reality soon came calling for Dumbledore, in the form of his siblings…"

Aberforth was set to return to Hogwarts and was fed up with Dumbledore’s plotting with Grindelwald – in addition to being concerned about Ariana’s care. He bluntly reminded Albus that he could not go searching for the Deathly Hallows with his fragile sister in tow. Albus and Gellert were not happy to have their dreams crushed and made their feelings clear. \n\nAccording to Aberforth, this involved Grindelwald becoming angry and calling him a stupid little boy. He told Aberforth that Ariana would no longer have to be hidden if he and Albus were successful and that he shouldn’t stand in their way. \n\nUnfortunately, this argument soon took a turn for the worse and escalated into a fight. Aberforth drew his wand and so did Gellert. He used the Cruciatus Curse on Aberforth, which prompted Albus to try and stop him. Soon, all three wizards were duelling. The loud noises and flashing lights caused immeasurable distress to Ariana, who then tried to become involved. Aberforth always maintained that she wanted to help but didn’t know how. Amidst all the chaos, she ended up dead. Though nobody knows who was the one to cast the curse that killed her, Grindelwald fled and that marked the end of his and Dumbledore’s friendship."

              "text": "## Their complicated ties in *Fantastic Beasts*\nBy the time we came across Dumbledore and Grindelwald in *Fantastic Beasts*, decades had passed since their summer together as teenagers. Grindelwald was still determined to enact his vision for the wizarding world. He had also managed to steal the Elder Wand from the wandmaker Gregorovitch – so was now in possession of one of the Deathly Hallows.\n\nMeanwhile, Dumbledore had taken a different path entirely. Distancing himself from Grindelwald, he had become a respected teacher at Hogwarts. He had also built up a reputation as a talented and powerful wizard – even if he did find himself at odds with the Ministry of Magic on occasion. In the ensuing years, he saw that his former friend was becoming even more dangerous (especially after Grindelwald’s escape from MACUSA custody at the beginning of *Crimes of Grindelwald*) but mysteriously refused to move against him – although many believed that he was the only wizard capable of stopping Grindelwald.\n\nWe soon learnt that Dumbledore’s refusal was due to the fact he was unable to oppose him, rather than unwilling. In the chaos caused by Grindelwald’s deadly rally in Paris, Teddy the Niffler stole a jewelled vial from the Dark wizard. It turned out to be a blood troth between Dumbledore and Grindelwald, which meant that they were prohibited from moving against each other. It also offered and added insight into their relationship as teenagers. They must have been extremely close to be willing to form such a pact.\n\nYet, as Newt presented the troth to Dumbledore at the end of *Crimes of Grindelwald*, we can’t help but wonder what that now means for the pair. Will Dumbledore be able to destroy it? Will he even want to? And though we know they supposedly don’t come face-to-face until their duel in 1945, does this now mean Dumbledore can move against the Dark wizard?"

When Harry unwrapped his first-ever Chocolate Frog, he got the Dumbledore card which read, ‘Professor Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the Dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945’ – though that’s the last we heard about that particular Dark wizard until the *Deathly Hallows*. It was in this book that we learnt about the pair’s turbulent past and how they knew each other so well. Yet it was also this book that showed us the end of Grindelwald’s story, when he was murdered in his cell at Nurmengard by Lord Voldemort – who was in pursuit of the Elder Wand. \n\nWhat made things interesting was that Grindelwald had refused to tell Voldemort where the Elder Wand was. He knew that Dumbledore was the current owner and he probably worked out that it remained with Dumbledore in his tomb. You might think that as Dumbledore was the reason that he was locked up, he would be more than happy to share the information with Voldemort, but he didn’t. It was his unspoken motivation behind that decision that was fascinating. \n\nSome say that in his fifty years in Nurmengard, Grindelwald had begun to show remorse for his actions. So, this could have been an attempt to try and make some small amends by stopping Voldemort from getting his hands on the Hallow. But it was Harry who raised another interesting and valid point. Harry said he may have withheld the information to stop Voldemort from desecrating Dumbledore’s tomb. If that had been the case, it could have meant that, despite everything that went on between them, Grindelwald still had a lingering affection or respect for his former friend…"

Though, if the trailers for *The Secrets of Dumbledore* are anything to go by, we might be about to learn a little more about that period of time. At the very least, we think we are going to get a deeper insight into their relationship.\n\nWe wonder whether this film will reveal more about the aforementioned blood troth and what Dumbledore decides to do with it. While it was arguably his relationship with Grindelwald that caused the death of his sister, the fractured bond with his brother and his own decision to never pursue power in the same way again, how easy would it really be for Dumbledore to move against someone with whom he had such a complex and long history?  \n\nOn another note, we can’t help but be curious about the glimpses we’ve seen of the pair together. They famously never came back into contact until their climactic duel in 1945… but was that really the case? Or is there more to their intricate history than we ever knew? What seems sure is that these two wizards appear to be bound to one another, and we’re excited to see where their story takes us next."

It was a mark of how much the class loathed Snape that they were all glaring at him, because every one of them had called Hermione a know-it-all at least once, and Ron, who told Hermione she was a know-it-all at least twice a week, said loudly, ‘You asked us a question and she knows the answer! Why ask if you don’t want to be told?’\n>\n>The class knew instantly he’d gone too far. Snape advanced on Ron slowly, and the room held its breath.\n>\n>‘Detention, Weasley,’ Snape said silkily, his face very close to Ron’s. ‘And if I ever hear you criticise the way I teach a class again, you will be very sorry indeed.’\n><br>*Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban*"

              "text": "## First things first, do you know your definitive Hogwarts house? \n\nI have it on the highest authority there is, in either the Muggle or Wizarding World, that I am and always be a Hufflepuff. And I’m proud to be a Hufflepuff, I may say. \n\n## You’ve come a long way with your relationship with Harry Potter – now exploring the many magical beasts in this new documentary – when you were reading the books, which magical creatures fascinated you? \n\nI was in a state of constant amazement as I read (both to myself and then read out loud) these evolving stories as more and more creatures appeared. Aragog the spider terrified me, even on the page. But I did like Buckbeak enormously and like a lot of people, I have a fantasy of just getting on the back of some enormous flying beast and sort of clutching their fur, their down or whatever it might be and flying away. I think that’s the thing that most thrilled me, no question. Fluffy, not so much! \n\n## During your work on this documentary, what was the most interesting thing you learnt about a fantastic beast – or a Muggle one?\n\nI was surprised by the obvious fact that our ancestors, thousands of years ago, would’ve happened on dinosaur fossils. I somehow had it in my head that dinosaur fossils were only discovered in the 1900s. But of course, our ancestors all round the world would’ve seen these things and wondered what they were. They had no way of knowing, if they saw a skull of some huge frightening beast, that that beast was extinct for millions of years! As far as they knew, it was around the next mountain or buried in a cave. And that suddenly made sense as to why there are dragon myths all over the world. At the exhibition there’s a marvellous dinosaur skeleton cast there of ‘Dracorex Hogwartsia’ which means ‘the dragon king of Hogwarts’ because it looks so like a dragon. It has little spurs on its jaw, and even though it’s a skeleton, there’s still a fierce look in its eye. So that was a great surprise and very interesting. \n\n## This documentary took you far and wide – where was the most exciting place to visit?\n\nI must say the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry in Utah is a pretty astonishing place. It’s the densest concentration of Jurassic fossils anywhere in the world. What’s so extraordinary, is that they’re all meat-eating dinosaurs. And usually, meat-eating animals, dinosaurs included, don’t gather together in communities. It’s animals that are afraid of being eaten that are in flocks and herds to protect themselves with numbers. People speculate what brought them there? But the woman who ran the place was brilliant and she told me a thing that still freaks me out...\n\nThe dinosaurs of the first Triassic period, say the gap between those early dinosaurs and T-Rex, is a longer gap than the gap between the T-Rex and the iPhone – think about that! It’s crazy. That just makes you shiver inside. One can think all kind of things around animals, but time? Time I can never get my head around. \n\n## A theme of the documentary is about the animals we’ve lost as time has elapsed. Climate change is a huge part of our day-to-day – what is your view on how we can change things for our planet and animals?\n\nThe loss of any species is a kind of crime against nature and time. Extinction is built into the world as we have it. There’s no question about that. We were talking about dinosaurs – they went extinct, and it wasn’t our fault. So why should we worry about whales, pandas, white rhinos and Yangtze River dolphins going extinct on our watch? And clearly because of pollution in the water or in other cases because of hunting – we know it’s our fault now. And somehow a new twist has happened in the history of evolution.\n\nThat we, these naked hairless apes that are, unlike any other type of ape and any other type of animal, have a consciousness that is aware and gives names to all of nature. We have this gift to be curious and it’s a vital gift. It means we know what’s happening. So, we can change our behaviour and be a guardian of creation. It’s an arrogant thing to be, perhaps. But it’s the duty we owe to the way we’ve evolved. I think it’s so important that we use that knowledge to do what we can. So that’s my hope! \n"

              "text": "## If you were to invent your own fantastic beast, what would it be? \n\nWell, this is such an interesting question, isn’t it? How does one invent a fantastic beast? It is impossible to do so without recalls to Mother Nature. I don’t think we humans, or we Muggles, need blame ourselves for our lack of imagination conjuring animals because Nature’s had 100s of millions of years to practise. Whereas we’ve only had a pin prick of time. Try and picture an animal that is in no way at all inspired by nature. It is impossible. Our brains are part of nature so we can’t think outside nature. Otherwise, you just come up with a robot which is a different thing. But the limits of the imagination give you more freedom. If you give yourself a small area to work, you can create a heck of a garden, but if you have a whole desert to work in, it’s a mess. It’s the same with the imagination. Give yourself rules and you’ll find that anything is possible.\n\n## If you could have one spell or type of magic, that you were able to use day-to-day, what would you pick?\n\nThe great Stan Lee was one of the most influential figures in the world of comics and he said luck. I thought it was a brilliant answer. It’s not really a magical gift, luck. But can you imagine being lucky? I think it would be fantastic. I think I like the stopping of time. Hermione was in charge of the Time-Turner and could stop time. I think that would be so exciting and interesting to go around the world with everybody frozen – I could just wreak havoc! That’s the naughty side of me. The side that would pull people’s trousers down and run away and then start time again and giggle… I mean that’s pathetic, isn’t it? Come on Stephen, come up with a more grownup answer. On the subject of time, going back in time to correct errors one has made, that’s a very strong impulse. Sometimes I wish I could have that moment back again and correct what I did. So that’s probably the one I would go for. \n\n## What shape would your Boggart take?\n\nMy Boggart would be an enormous moth. I know moths are beautiful, but for some reason I’ve always been terrified of them. I think because when I was young, all I did was read through the night because I found it difficult to get to sleep. I was in the countryside, and it would be very hot at the top of the house where my bed was, so I would open the window to make it cooler. But if you open the window and you’ve got the light on to read, moths come in. They’d get in my hair, and I just freaked out… they were big and leathery somehow. So, a huge moth I’m afraid would just completely make me turn to jelly. \n\n## Which character from the Wizarding World are you most drawn to?\n\nI think we all need a friend and lot of us yearn for a friend who can be a guide. Dumbledore is quite remote, but that’s the point, he has authority. We all want a mentor. Even when you’re as old as I am you think it would be nice to have a mentor. Someone you could say ‘what should I do now?’ and ‘give me advice’. Someone you could trust because we live in a world where there aren’t many people we can look up to and trust… David Attenborough’s about the only one. It’s a sad state for the world to be in. So, we need a Dumbledore, we need figures like that. \n\n## And finally, why do you think the Wizarding World is still so loved today?\n\nWe live in our time where technology has impinged on our lives more than ever. Certainly, 100 years ago, cars were starting to take off and that sort of thing. But computing and mobile technology and all the other technologies are building in a great swell around us like a tsunami. Now technology is so much a part of us. I think that means we miss things that are purely from nature. In a digital world, you yearn for the analogue. And when I was young, we didn’t think of myths, dragons and fantasy nearly as much as we did when computing became big. That’s when things like Lord of the Rings and, of course, Harry Potter really made their mark on the world. At exactly the time that Silicon Valley was exploding. I don’t think that’s a coincidence, I think that’s a reaction. Of course, we love our shiny gadgets, but we want to return to a world too where not everything is explained by mathematics and programming and coding – but another kind of magic. That’s my theory."

That man the Death Eaters killed was your godfather, wasn’t he? Ginny told me.’\n>\n>Harry nodded curtly, but found that for some reason he did not mind Luna talking about Sirius. He had just remembered that she, too, could see Thestrals.\n>\n>‘Have you...’ he began. ‘I mean, who... has anyone you known ever died?’\n>\n>‘Yes,’ said Luna simply, ‘my mother. She was a quite extraordinary witch, you know, but she did like to experiment and one of her spells went rather badly wrong one day. I was nine.’\n>\n>‘I’m sorry,’ Harry mumbled.\n>\n>‘Yes, it was rather horrible,’ said Luna conversationally. ‘I still feel very sad about it sometimes. But I’ve still got Dad.

There were Molly and Arthur who’d had a strong and loving partnership since their days at Hogwarts. Ron and Hermione whose relationship had been a slow burn from best friends into something more. Tonks and Remus who had to break down barriers, including Remus’ low self-esteem stemming from being a werewolf, to eventually be together. And Bill and Fleur, whose powerful connection eventually managed to change his family’s preconceived notions about her. And these are just a handful of the strong pairings found in the wizarding world – there are so many other excellent illustrations of romantic love. Many of these couples (if not all) also had to overcome forces that were trying to keep them apart – whether those obstacles were external like the rise of Voldemort, or internal such as their own stubbornness. Yet ultimately, they all demonstrated the enduring power of love."

Whether they’re those related by blood or those that have chosen to be each other’s family. The Weasley clan definitely had a strong bond – even when it was tested by Percy’s estrangement. What made them doubly special, was how they were willing to welcome others into the fold with open arms (with the brief hesitation when it came to Fleur). Harry was welcomed as a bonus Weasley from when he was in first-year and Molly sent him one of her signature hand-knitted jumper for Christmas. And they weren’t the only family who truly demonstrated what love means – the Lovegoods also cared deeply for one another. When Luna was taken by the Death Eaters, Xenophilius would have done anything to get ger back, including going against all his principles and turning Harry over to the Death Eaters. There were also the Longbottoms who stuck together through adversity. There was Sirius who took his role as godfather to Harry incredibly seriously... we could go on and on. Though one thing is for certain, and that is family (in whatever form it took) was a powerful example of love in the wizarding world. "

After all, if it wasn’t for Harry Ron and Hermione’s bond, you could argue that Harry would not have been able to defeat Voldemort. Each of them brought something unique to their friendship, such as Harry’s bravery, Hermione’s cleverness and Ron’s loyalty. There is no doubt in our minds that they were always strongest when together. And they were by no means the only fantastic friendship to be found in the wizarding world. Seamus and Dean were rarely without one another for instance. Fred, George and Lee were the perfect pranking trio. Lily and Snape demonstrated you could be friends with someone from a different house. And without the four Marauders (yes, even Wormtail at one point), there would never have been the Marauder’s Map, which proved to be vital on more than one occasion. Platonic love can be just as strong as romantic love."

Hagrid was someone who perfectly encapsulated this. He adored creatures of all kinds and always saw the good in them – even when many others could not. It took a certain kind of person to be doe-eyed over an Acromantula, three-headed dog, baby dragon or a Blast-Ended Skrewt and happily raise them – yet Hagrid managed to. Another person who had a deep affection for all fantastic beasts was Newt Scamander. As a Magizoologist his whole life was dedicated to creatures, and he always showed them respect and kindness. From the beasts he kept in his case, to the menagerie in his basement, you know that every single one of them was cared for and valued. We think that the love Hagrid and Newt had for every creature was incredibly pure and other people in the wizarding world could have learnt a lot from them. "

It was the love she had for her son that made her willing to sacrifice her own life to save his. And it was that love that not only saved Harry from the Killing Curse when he was an infant, but also protected him from Voldemort until he was seventeen years old.\n\nAnd Lily wasn’t the only one prepared to sacrifice themselves for those they cared about, this was something Harry did too. At the end of the Battle of Hogwarts he willingly went to meet Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest – knowing he was walking to his death. He knew that if he surrendered, he would save his friends, chosen family and those that were fighting with him. Luckily, we know he survived a second time – but at that moment he certainly didn’t.\n\nFinally, another quieter sacrifice that we have to mention was when Hermione erased her parents’ memories of her and sent them to Australia. It was her love for them that drove her to do this. She knew that it was the only way to keep them safe from Voldemort while she embarked on the hunt for Horcruxes. Though it must have been unbearably painful for her, it was also a very brave and selfless thing for her to do. "
