              "text": "On Tuesday 29th March, MinaLima will unveil their latest artworks at House of MinaLima in Soho, London: a collection of rich and colourful designs highlighting the international magical cultures of *Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore*. From German wizarding newspapers to Gellert Grindelwald wanted posters, there is a whole new smorgasbord of wizarding world artistry to take in.  \n\nThe graphic design team, who worked extensively across the Harry Potter films and the first two Fantastic Beasts films, are back to immerse in the wizarding world once again, embracing vintage, Art Nouveau and Art Deco styles that have permeated the look of the Fantastic Beasts stories, which are set in the 1920s.\n\n![minalima-fb3-exclusive-print-dumbledore-crest](//images.ctfassets.net/usf1vwtuqyxm/320cjhRzfA0yt8nrtF73YI/28ae50ec6b828be2adfb749135e18682/dumbledore-crest.jpg)\n\nAs always, the team conducted historical research and employed experimental techniques when creating the designs for the film, to properly embrace the style of the period. \n\nThe prints will also take fans’ imaginations around the world, observing numerous international magical cultures expected to be seen in the new film, such as the German Ministry of Magic, and pivotal characters from Brazil and China. Other prints highlight interesting plot points of the film, such as Grindelwald wanted posters, the Dumbledore family emblem, featuring a majestic phoenix, the German newspaper, Die Silberne Fledermaus and a glimpse at a new magical train to get excited about: The Great Wizarding Express. Bookworms will enjoy seeing some new fictional tomes that feature in the film, such as a collection of 10 wizarding books created for Professor Lally – and a gilded front cover for the second edition of Newt Scamander’s best-seller, (what else?) *Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them*. \n\nOne standout piece, created in collaboration with the wider film production, will display the Magisterial Chamber of Ancient Wizardry, a hideaway of the highest seat of the magical world in Bhutan. Like much of MinaLima’s work,  eagle-eyed fans can examine these pieces to pick out meticulously detailed motifs and symbols. \n\nSo, stay tuned for further reveals from this gorgeous collection – all in celebration of [Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbedore](https://www.wizardingworld.com/collections/fantastic-beasts-the-secrets-of-dumbledore), coming to UK cinemas on Friday 8th April, with a wider release following on the 15th. \n\nAnd if you’re London-based, why don’t you pop down to MinaLima’s home, the House of MinaLima, to see the new prints in person? \n\nThe curated collection of Graphic Art of Fantastic Beasts will also be on exhibit at House of MinaLima New York, House of MinaLima Osaka and House of MinaLima Paju from Friday 8 April 2022.\n\nVisit the [MinaLima website for more details. ](https://minalima.com/)"

In the end, she sided with Grindelwald as a result of wanting to break down these strict laws. We were devastated to see Queenie crossover to join the Dark wizard – but where will she go in this film? We remain tentatively optimistic. \n\nSo that’s one Goldstein sister. But what about Tina? As mentioned in *Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald*, Tina was reinstated as an Auror at MACUSA, so perhaps she’s off attending to official business?

Go to our app and type in the secret code FBQUIZCHAMPIONSHIP to find some handy materials that may give you the edge. It’s the Hermione-way. \n\nYou can download the app right here or with the handy QR below.\n\n![wizarding-world-app-qr-code-with-padding](//images.ctfassets.net/usf1vwtuqyxm/19sj3D6vOwqCj1FAWayhW7/25a5a201a196b9e9b4bc03a44b34db34/QR-wizarding-world-app-code-with-padding.png)\n\nThe winning Hogwarts house will be celebrated online, where you can expect our website to be adorned in the colours of the winner – just like you would see in the Great Hall at Hogwarts. \n\nFor now, we wish you happy studying, happy Fantastic Beasts re-watching, and a big hearty good luck.

As the project unfolded, Jim decided that it was time to bring in guest collaborator and dear friend, Neil Packer, to help bring the story to life. As Jim said: \n\n‘Illustrating *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix* was always going to be a challenge; the scale of the book meant for a huge variety of characters and locations to choose from. It was a great privilege to have Neil Packer helping with this daunting task. As a fan of his work it was wonderful to see his illustrations appear in the text, and so nice to be working with him in the team. He is perfect for Potter.’ \n\nNeil Packer adds: ‘As both a friend and a colleague it was an honour to be asked to work alongside Jim Kay on this book. Jim has invested so much in this series already and I was very conscious of not wanting to encroach on the stunning work which only he can do. The sheer scale of this book and the wonderful richness of imagination within the writing perhaps left space for a second approach and it has been a great joy and a challenge to try and work in harmony with Jim’s pictures and to visualise some of J.K. Rowling’s wizarding world.’\n\nNeil is a well-renowned illustrator in his own right, and his distinctive artwork has been woven through the book complementing Jim’s narrative scenes. One example of his exquisite artwork is this beautiful imagining of Firenze’s Divination classroom."

Rowling, to discuss the inspirations behind the creatures we meet in Harry Potter and Fantastic Beasts, while also meeting with visual effects supervisor Christian Manz, who has lent his talents to several Wizarding World movies, bringing countless magical creations to life. \n\nSo, stay tuned for *Fantastic Beasts: A Natural History*, which will feature on BBC One, iPlayer, HBO Max and international broadcasters very soon.\n\n[And remember to sign up to the Harry Potter Fan Club](https://my.wizardingworld.com/register) for all the latest Wizarding World news updates, including more info on Fantastic Beasts: A Natural History.
